The phrase comes from a controversial fifth season episode (aired in 1977) in which a lead character literally jumped over a shark on water skis. Idiomatically, it is used to refer to the moment when a once-great show becomes ridiculous and rapidly looses quality.\nIs it true that episodes from later seasons of Happy Days have lower average ratings than the early seasons?\nANSWER : Yes, it is true. Because the tvseries rating in 2008 have an average 5.4 rating, which is lower\n\nhappy_days &lt;- high_avrg_episode |&gt; \n  filter(primaryTitle == \"Happy Days\", titleType == \"tvSeries\")\n\n\n\n\nDesign a ‘success’ measure for IMDb entries, reflecting both quality and broad popular awareness. Implement your success metric using a mutate operator to add a new column to the TITLE_RATINGS table.\nChoose the top 5-10 movies on your metric and confirm that they were indeed box office successes.\nMy strategy is to use the highest ratings &gt; 9 and then filter to highest numVotes from there. It is how I get my top 5 below.\nANSWER: TOP 5 with high ratings, grater than 9.0, and with highest numVotes[IMDb entries], indicates success. See below success metrics\n1.The Shawshank Redemption,1994,Drama,ratings = 9.3, numVotes = 2953131.\n2. The Godfather,1972,Crime,Drama, ratings = 9.2, numVotes = 2058741\n3.

The Silence of Swastika, 2021, Documentary,History, ratings = 9.2, numVotes = 10567\nChoose 3-5 movies with large numbers of IMDb votes that score poorly on your success metric and confirm that they are indeed of low quality.# #My strategy is to get the worst ratings &lt; than 1-2, and then filter to highest numVotes to get my worst performers below.\nANSWER: TOP 3 with high numVotes [even grater than some of the top 5], and lowest rating, at less than 2.0 rating, indicates low quality.\n1.Radhe, 2021, Action,Crime,Thriller, ratings = 1.9, numVotes = 180240\n2.Sadak 2, 2020, Action,Drama, ratings = 1.2, numVotes = 96842\n3.Disaster Movie, 2008, Comedy,Sci-Fi, ratings = 1.9, numVotes = 95313\nPerform at least one other form of ‘spot check’ validation.\nI will use scatter plots using for my top 5 and low 3.

The results where visible following a trend where the higher the rating the higher the numVotes. #Unfortunatley strategy one was picking up multiple outliers, and could not base a recomendation on outliers only; a trend was not clearly visible with strategy 1.\nCombining both together. I have identified as movies &gt; 5 ratings with 2M NumVotes to be top performing movies.

A new Genre.\nI propose to create a movie similar to the greatest hit ‘The Shawshank Redemption’, Inspired by Stephen King’s book “Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption”, Produced and stared by Morgan Freeman , one of the greatest inspirational person in media now.\nThe movie could follow a similar plot as Stephen King book to start, innocent man/woman in jail, finds purpose in life. But instead of a killing it could be another type of crime, like crossing a border, or robbing to survive, or falsely accusations.\nThe name for the movie could be “Innocent until proven Guilty” narrated by Morgan Freeman and Edith Mathis. Stared by a fresh set of new diverse actors, never seen actors - the normal everyday person as an actor.

Idiomatically, it is used to refer to the moment when a once-great show becomes ridiculous and rapidly looses quality.\nIs it true that episodes from later seasons of Happy Days have lower average ratings than the early seasons?\nANSWER : Yes, it is true.

The phrase comes from a controversial fifth season episode (aired in 1977) in which a lead character literally jumped over a shark on water skis. Idiomatically, it is used to refer to the moment when a once-great show becomes ridiculous and rapidly looses quality.\nIs it true that episodes from later seasons of Happy Days have lower average ratings than the early seasons?\nANSWER : Yes, it is true. Because the tvseries rating in 2008 have an average 5.4 rating, which is lower\n\nhappy_days &lt;- high_avrg_episode |&gt; \n  filter(primaryTitle == \"Happy Days\", titleType == \"tvSeries\")\n\n\n\n\nDesign a ‘success’ measure for IMDb entries, reflecting both quality and broad popular awareness. Implement your success metric using a mutate operator to add a new column to the TITLE_RATINGS table.\nChoose the top 5-10 movies on your metric and confirm that they were indeed box office successes.\nMy strategy is to use the highest ratings &gt; 9 and then filter to highest numVotes from there. It is how I get my top 5 below.\nANSWER: TOP 5 with high ratings, grater than 9.0, and with highest numVotes[IMDb entries], indicates success. See below success metrics\n1.The Shawshank Redemption,1994,Drama,ratings = 9.3, numVotes = 2953131.\n2. The Godfather,1972,Crime,Drama, ratings = 9.2, numVotes = 2058741\n3. The Chaos Class, 1975, Comedy,ratings = 9.2,numVotes = 43592\n4. Ramayana: The Legend of Prince Rama, 1993, Action,Adventure,Animation, ratings = 9.2, numVotes = 15433\n5. The Silence of Swastika, 2021, Documentary,History, ratings = 9.2, numVotes = 10567\nChoose 3-5 movies with large numbers of IMDb votes that score poorly on your success metric and confirm that they are indeed of low quality.# #My strategy is to get the worst ratings &lt; than 1-2, and then filter to highest numVotes to get my worst performers below.\nANSWER: TOP 3 with high numVotes [even grater than some of the top 5], and lowest rating, at less than 2.0 rating, indicates low quality.\n1.Radhe, 2021, Action,Crime,Thriller, ratings = 1.9, numVotes = 180240\n2.Sadak 2, 2020, Action,Drama, ratings = 1.2, numVotes = 96842\n3.Disaster Movie, 2008, Comedy,Sci-Fi, ratings = 1.9, numVotes = 95313\nPerform at least one other form of ‘spot check’ validation.\nI will use scatter plots using for my top 5 and low 3. Compare that to scatter plots with &lt; / &gt; 5 ratings- I am cutting at midpoint ratings because &lt; 2 or &gt; 9 may be too ambiguous - &lt;/&gt; 5 will even out. to keep data plot small, I am using 50 points.\n\n#Plot1 movies at &gt; 9 ratings, a trend is not clearly visible, looks like a straight horizontal line with a couple of outliers.\n\nsucess1 &lt;- full_join(TITLE_BASICS,TITLE_RATINGS, by = \"tconst\") |&gt; \n  select(tconst, titleType, primaryTitle, startYear,genres, averageRating,numVotes) |&gt; \n  filter(titleType == \"movie\", averageRating &gt; 9) |&gt; \n  group_by(primaryTitle) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(numVotes)) \n\nplot1 = head(sucess1, 50) \n\nggplot(plot1, aes(x=averageRating, y=numVotes)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#Plot2 movies at ratings &gt; 5, The grater the rating the higher the numVotes trend\n\nsucess2&lt;- full_join(TITLE_BASICS,TITLE_RATINGS, by = \"tconst\") |&gt; \n  select(tconst, titleType, primaryTitle, startYear,genres, averageRating,numVotes) |&gt; \n  filter(titleType == \"movie\", averageRating &gt; 5) |&gt; \n  group_by(primaryTitle) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(numVotes)) \n\nplot2 = head(sucess2, 50)\n\nggplot(plot2, aes(x=averageRating, y=numVotes)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#Below is the spot check for worst perfoming using same strategy for best perfomring [graphs]\n\n#PLOT3 movies at ratings &lt;2 - slightly see pattern of the higher the rating the higher numVotes, however there is a less numVote concentration\n\nsucess_not &lt;- full_join(TITLE_BASICS,TITLE_RATINGS, by = \"tconst\") |&gt; \n  select(tconst, titleType, primaryTitle, startYear,genres, averageRating,numVotes) |&gt; \n  filter(titleType == \"movie\", averageRating &lt; 2) |&gt; \n  group_by(primaryTitle) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(numVotes)) \n\nplot3 = head(sucess_not, 50) \n\nggplot(plot3, aes(x=averageRating, y=numVotes)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#PLOT 4 movies at ratings &lt; 5 - the higher the rating the grater the numVotes\n\nsucess_not2 &lt;- full_join(TITLE_BASICS,TITLE_RATINGS, by = \"tconst\") |&gt; \n  select(tconst, titleType, primaryTitle, startYear,genres, averageRating,numVotes) |&gt; \n  filter(titleType == \"movie\", averageRating &lt; 5) |&gt; \n  group_by(primaryTitle) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(numVotes)) \n\nplot4 = head(sucess_not2, 50) \n\nggplot(plot4, aes(x=averageRating, y=numVotes)) + \n  geom_point() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCome up with a numerical threshold for a project to be a ‘success’; that is, determine a value such that movies above are all “solid” or better.\nMy initial hypothesis was the higher the ratings the higher the numVotes will be. #I used an initial strategy where I picked very high ratings vs. very low ratings + spot check [graph] strategy where I cut data at midpoint ratings &lt;/&gt;5 ratings.\nAfter graphing both with a sample of 50 highest NumVotes, the graph strategy pointed to a better data visual, a clear trend. The results where visible following a trend where the higher the rating the higher the numVotes. #Unfortunatley strategy one was picking up multiple outliers, and could not base a recomendation on outliers only; a trend was not clearly visible with strategy 1.\nCombining both together. I have identified as movies &gt; 5 ratings with 2M NumVotes to be top performing movies. And movies at &lt; 5 ratings with &lt;25K numVotes as worst performers [for a shorter list of worst performers- low ratings with high numVotes will give me worst performers].\nFINAL SUCESS CODE AND PLOT\n\nFinal_sucess &lt;- full_join(TITLE_BASICS,TITLE_RATINGS, by = \"tconst\") |&gt; \n  select(tconst, titleType, primaryTitle, startYear,genres, averageRating,numVotes) |&gt; \n  filter(titleType == \"movie\", averageRating &gt; 5, numVotes &gt; 2000000) |&gt; \n  group_by(primaryTitle) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(numVotes)) \n\nplot_final = head(Final_sucess, 50) \n\nggplot(plot_final, aes(x=averageRating, y=numVotes))  +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFINAL SUCESS NOT CODE AND PLOT\n\nFinal_sucess_NOT &lt;- full_join(TITLE_BASICS,TITLE_RATINGS, by = \"tconst\") |&gt; \n  select(tconst, titleType, primaryTitle, startYear,genres, averageRating,numVotes) |&gt; \n  filter(titleType == \"movie\", averageRating &lt; 5, numVotes &lt; 25000) |&gt; \n  group_by(primaryTitle) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(numVotes)) \n\nplot_final_not = head(Final_sucess_NOT, 50) \n\nggplot(plot_final_not, aes(x=averageRating, y=numVotes)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat was the genre with the most “successes” in each decade?\n\nsucess_decade &lt;- full_join(TITLE_BASICS,TITLE_RATINGS, by = \"tconst\") |&gt; \n  select(tconst, titleType, primaryTitle, startYear,genres, averageRating,numVotes) |&gt; \n  filter(titleType == \"movie\", averageRating &gt; 5, numVotes &gt; 1000000) |&gt; \n  group_by(primaryTitle) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(numVotes)) |&gt; \n  separate_longer_delim(genres, \",\") \n\nplt = head(sucess_decade, 500)\n\nggplot(plt, aes(startYear, averageRating)) + \n  geom_point(aes(colour = factor(genres)))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat genre consistently has the most “successes”?

The original should have a large number of IMDb ratings, a high average rating, and not have been remade in the past 25 years.4\nOnce you have found your classic movie to remake, confirm whether key actors, directors, or writers from the original are still alive. If so, you need to contact your legal department to ensure they can secure the rights to the project. You may also want to include the classic actors as “fan service.”\nANSWER: I’m not a fan of remakes, so I would propose an entirely new movie based on the hit ‘The Shawshank Redemption’ - at the time it high very high ratings and votes. Give the people what they like. As a fan of Morgan Freeman and Stephen King, I would propose King write a new drama/thriller/inspirational, and Freeman star and produce it. Perfect combo and still alive doing great content. My team will contact them.\n\n\n\nIn today’s environment, the pattern has been to remake and create movies that resemble a ‘passing the torch’ feeling.\nTake for example a classic Hocus Pocus, or GhostBusters, or recet Bettle Juice, a recreation of the old. It start to look like a series and not a movie.\nWhy not create an entirely new generation of movies, to both inspire the new generations while at the same time rekindle the nostalgia of the older generations.\nI propose a making of a new type of DRAMA, DRAMA101 - Where our movies will contain multiple genres, from drama, thriller [for oldies], inspirational [for sensitivity of today’s environment], touch of comedy [reflecting real life]. A mix. New.\nWhy not reflect the different stages/ feelings in one movie?\n“Inside Out” you may be thinking…“childish” you say…\nNO…rather this is reality, a movie should reflect a reality of life. A new Genre.\nI propose to create a movie similar to the greatest hit ‘The Shawshank Redemption’, Inspired by Stephen King’s book “Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption”, Produced and stared by Morgan Freeman , one of the greatest inspirational person in media now.\nThe movie could follow a similar plot as Stephen King book to start, innocent man/woman in jail, finds purpose in life. But instead of a killing it could be another type of crime, like crossing a border, or robbing to survive, or falsely accusations.\nThe name for the movie could be “Innocent until proven Guilty” narrated by Morgan Freeman and Edith Mathis. Stared by a fresh set of new diverse actors, never seen actors - the normal everyday person as an actor. Are you ready to bring the next genre of the movie future.\n‘Out with the old and in with the new.’\n\n!
